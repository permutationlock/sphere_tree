Sphere Tree Collision Detection
-------------------------------
In this project I created a simple implementation
of a sphere tree system for modeling object
collision meshes.  If you make the project you
will be able to play around with various sphere
tree depths for a simple cube and observe how
close to perfect collision detection becomes
after a few depth levels.
